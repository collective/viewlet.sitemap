Introduction
============

Sometimes you may want to generate a sitemap in a viewlet.

Some use-cases could be: present a sitemap in the footer of
your site. Another case could be to use drop-down navigational
menus. With some XSL transformations in your diazo theme, this
viewlet can easily provide just that.
